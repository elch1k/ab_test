**A brief preface:** This repository has been transformed from a single project into a collection of projects and resources related to A/B testing, statistics, and probability.

`AB_test_project.ipynb` contains a report of an A/B test analysis, comparing two groups with a continuous metric (average customer check) using both bootstrap and non-parametric Mann-Whitney U tests to determine significance. This project utilizes [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sergylog/ab-test-data) data, which presented significant quality issues and did not adhere to proper splitter and test design principles. Consequently, extensive data preprocessing was necessary. This allowed for the implementation of A/B testing approaches, which you can explore further via the provided [link](https://github.com/elch1k/ab_test/blob/main/AB_test_project.ipynb).

*New notebooks and resources are coming soon!*
