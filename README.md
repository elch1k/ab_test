Here I dive into ordinary Data Analyst task to make a common AB test. As I mentioned in .ipynb file it's really necessary to properly model the whole experiment: determine hypotesis, choose right metrics and randomization units, calculating sample size with a predetermined power and significance level and etc.. 
This is a truly difficult and expensive process that a company must be confident in choosing. In my way I just grab data from the [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sergylog/ab-test-data) and then just make some research and AB test analysing. Since I did not have clear conditions for what to research, I simply took into account all possible variants that might be interesting from this AB test data.
